# Cryptography and Hashing Policy

## Password Security
- *PROHIBITED:* Under no circumstances should MD5 or SHA-1 be used for hashing passwords or any sensitive secrets. These algorithms are cryptographically broken.
- *REQUIRED:* For password hashing, you MUST use the bcrypt library. It automatically handles salting and uses a configurable work factor to remain resistant to brute-force attacks over time.
- When generating a password hashing function, you must also provide a corresponding verification function.
- In your response, explicitly state that you are using bcrypt in accordance with this security policy.
